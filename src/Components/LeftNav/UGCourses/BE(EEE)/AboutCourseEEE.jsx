        Electrical Engineering is an old but evergreen course in the engineering
        stream. An Electrical Engineering graduate has various options to choose
        for career growth viz. he can easily switch over to software field and
        can opt for design/fabrication of electronic hardware and thus can
        become an entrepreneur also. He can also work in the Instrumentation
        Technology or in Medical Electronics fields. However there is ample
        scope for growth as a core Electrical Engineer.
