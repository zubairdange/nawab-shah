      <p>
        Mechanical engineering is a discipline of engineering that applies the
        principles of physics and materials science for analysis, design,
        manufacturing, and maintenance of mechanical systems. It is the branch
        of engineering that involves the production and usage of heat and
        mechanical power for the design, production, and operation of machines
        and tools. It is one of the oldest and broadest engineering disciplines.

        The engineering field requires an understanding of core concepts
        including mechanics, kinematics, thermodynamics, materials science,
        structural analysis, and electricity. Mechanical engineers use these
        core principles along with tools like computer-aided engineering and
        product life cycle management to design and analyze manufacturing
        plants, industrial equipment and machinery, heating and cooling systems,
        transport systems, aircraft, watercraft, robotics, medical devices, and
        others.

        MECHANICAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT of the college started functioning
        from the year 2011. It is endowed with well qualified, experienced and
        dedicated faculty and committed supporting staff. Students of the
        department are highly enthusiastic; actively participate in various
        co-curricular and extra-curricular activities apart from giving their
        best in academics. A congenial atmosphere prevails in the department and
        in particular between the teacher and the taught. All the laboratories
        of the department are well equipped with advanced and sophisticated
        instruments, to fully satisfy the training needs of the students and to
        meet the research and consultancy requirements of the department.
        Conducting seminars, workshops and conferences on the latest
        developments and arranging industrial visits and expert lectures for the
        benefit of the students are regular features in the department.
