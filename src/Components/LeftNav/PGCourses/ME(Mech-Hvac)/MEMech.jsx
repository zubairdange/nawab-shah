      <h4>AN INTRODUCTION TO SE</h4>
      <p>
        The design of the HVAC component is critical to achieve an efficient and
        effective environmental control system. The successful integration of
        building constraints, air movement conditions and equipment selection
        can positively impact system overall performance and decrease utility
        expenses and capital expenditures. To achieve the optimal design, one
        should needs good analytical skills and up-to-date technical knowledge
        of various system designs.
