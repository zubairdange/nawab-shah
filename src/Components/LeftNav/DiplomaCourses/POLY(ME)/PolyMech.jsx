      <h5>Diploma In Mechanical Engineering.</h5>
      <p>
        The college offers Polytechnic (Mechanical Engineering) course whose
        details are given below:
      </p>
      <h4>AN INTRODUCTION TO MECHANICAL ENGINEERING</h4>
      <p>
        A study in mechanical engineering, hence, will equip you with this basic
        knowledge of movement and the power / energy that is involved, which
        makes it possible. The scope of study and the flexibility of career
        choice enjoyed by this field of engineering is unmatched by any other
        field.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mechanical engineering study is applied in the design and control of
        systems and processes involved in – manufacturing plants, automobiles,
        aircrafts, machine tools, air-conditioning, refrigeration, boilers,
        power plants, fuel processing etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the Diploma in Mechanical Engineering (ME), you can look forward to
        creating and designing products for diverse sectors. You will gain a
        strong foundation and become a competent mechanical engineer. This
        practice oriented course will provide you with the latest computational
        skills and technology to be at the forefront of the industry. ME’s
        strong emphasis on design empowers you for value-added engineering jobs
        such as the generation and use of energy, creation of new materials,
        process design, and the manufacture of a wide array of products ranging
        from home appliances to medical devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our College offers the course work of VI semester for Diploma in
        Mechanical Engineering.
